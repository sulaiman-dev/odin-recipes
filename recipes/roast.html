    <p>
      I have had this recipe for a long time, and always
      enjoy making it. You can also do the same thing with
      beef or pork
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oi</li>
      <li>1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move
        oven rack to the center position.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine bread crumbs, garlic,
        rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
        Toss in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten mixture.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the rack all over with salt and pepper. Heat
        2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven proof
        skillet over high heat. Sear rack of lamb for 1 to 2
        minutes on all sides. Set aside for a few minutes.
        Brush rack of lamb with the mustard. Roll in the
        bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the
        ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the rack bone side down in the skillet.
        Roast the lamb in preheated oven for 12 to 18
        minutes, depending on the degree of doneness you
        want. With a meat thermometer, take a reading in the
        center of the meat after 10 to 12 minutes and remove
        the meat, or let it cook longer, to your taste. Let
        it rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered, before
        carving between the ribs.
