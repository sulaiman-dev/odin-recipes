      Nothing says summer like grilled BBQ chicken. Serve
      with grilled corn, you're pretty much tasting America.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups sweet barbeque sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup Italian salad dressing</li>
      <li>4 (8 ounce) bone-in chicken legs with skin</li>
      <li>hickory wood chips as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix barbecue sauce and salad dressing together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put chicken legs in a large zip-top bag and pour
        sauce all over them. Squeeze out the excess air and
        seal the bag. Massage marinade into the chicken a
        bit, then refrigerate for 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the refrigerator; set bag on the
        counter and bring to room temperature, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat and
        lightly oil the grate. Load a smoker box with wood
        chips and set on the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to the
        preheated grill. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then
        flip, basting both sides with the remaining
        marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to cook (with the lid closed and listening
        for flare-ups) until chicken is no longer pink at
        the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 more
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near
        the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken to a platter and tent with foil. Let
        rest for 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
